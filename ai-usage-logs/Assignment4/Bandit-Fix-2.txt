       27 +      HOST = os.environ.get('HOST', '127.0.0.1')
       28 +      PORT = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5001))  # Changed from

⏺ Fixed the B104 network binding issue in config.py:25-28. Changes made:

  1. HOST: Changed from hardcoded '0.0.0.0' to os.environ.get('HOST', 
  '127.0.0.1')
    - Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost only) for secure local development
    - Can be overridden via HOST environment variable for production/Docker
  deployments
  2. PORT: Also made configurable via environment variable for consistency

  For Docker/production use, you can set HOST=0.0.0.0 in your environment or
   docker-compose.yml when you need the app to be accessible from outside
  the container.
