  Detailed Vulnerability Information

  CVE-2024-1135

  - Severity: HIGH
  - Affected Package: gunicorn 21.2.0
  - Fixed In: 22.0.0
  - CWE: CWE-444 (Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests)
  - Description: Gunicorn fails to properly validate Transfer-Encoding

  - Reference: https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-1135

  CVE-2024-6827

  - Severity: HIGH
  - Affected Package: gunicorn 21.2.0
  - Fixed In: 22.0.0
  - CWE: CWE-444 (Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests)
  - Description: Gunicorn does not properly validate the 'Transfer-Encoding'
   header per RFC standards, making it vulnerable to TE.CL request
  smuggling.
  - Impact: Cache poisoning, SSRF, XSS, DoS, data integrity compromise,
  security bypass
  - Reference: https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-6827

  Recommended Remediation

  Action Required: Update gunicorn from version 21.2.0 to 22.0.0 or later.

  # Update requirements.txt
  # Change: gunicorn==21.2.0
  # To:     gunicorn==22.0.0

  # Then rebuild:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  # Or for Docker:
  docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build

  Both HIGH severity vulnerabilities are fixed by the same upgrade, making
  remediation straightforward.
