> Help me create a professional PDF report from my Assignment 4 markdown notes.
> I have security testing results documented but need to format them into a
> proper academic report with table of contents, headers, and professional styling.

⏺ Let me help you set up a markdown-to-PDF workflow using pandoc with LaTeX.
  This approach allows you to write in markdown while generating professional
  PDF output with full control over formatting.

⏺ Read(Assignment-4-Report-WIP.md)
  ⎿  Read 450 lines (initial draft with raw notes)

⏺ Creating build-report.sh - Pandoc Build Script

> Create a shell script to convert markdown to PDF using pandoc with xelatex

⏺ Write(build-report.sh)
  ⎿  Created 28 lines

  Script configuration:
  - pdf-engine: xelatex (better font and Unicode support than pdflatex)
  - geometry: 1in margins with header/footer space
  - colorlinks: Blue hyperlinks for URLs and cross-references
  - fontsize: 11pt with Arial font family
  - linestretch: 1.15 for readability
  - documentclass: report (supports chapters and sections)
  - toc: Automatic table of contents with 3-level depth
  - Custom header.tex for advanced styling

  Key pandoc options:
  ```bash
  pandoc "$INPUT" -o "$OUTPUT" \
    --pdf-engine=xelatex \
    -V geometry:margin=1in \
    -V fontsize=11pt \
    -V mainfont="Arial" \
    --toc \
    --toc-depth=3 \
    -H header.tex
  ```

⏺ Verification: chmod +x build-report.sh && ./build-report.sh

⏺ Creating header.tex - Custom LaTeX Styling

> The tables and code blocks look cramped. Create custom LaTeX to improve styling.

⏺ Write(header.tex)
  ⎿  Created 68 lines

  Styling components added:

  1. Header/Footer with fancyhdr:
     - Left header: Current section name
     - Right header: "CS763 - Assignment 4"
     - Center footer: Page number
     - Horizontal rules above/below

  2. Table improvements:
     - booktabs, longtable, tabularx packages
     - Zebra striping with alternating row colors
     - Smaller font size (\small) for better fit
     - Array stretch 1.1 for padding

  3. Code block styling:
     - Light gray background (#F5F5F5)
     - Framed with subtle border
     - Smaller font for better fit
     - Line breaking enabled (fvextra)

  4. Typography:
     - Widow/orphan penalty (no single lines at page breaks)
     - Disabled hyphenation (no awkward word breaks)
     - Emergency stretch for line breaking

⏺ Report Structure Development

> Help me organize the report with proper academic structure

⏺ Update(Assignment-4-Report.md)
  ⎿  Restructured content into sections:

  1. Introduction
     - 1.1 Assignment Objectives
     - 1.2 Tools Selected
     - 1.3 Tool Selection Rationale

  2. SAST Analysis with Bandit
     - 2.1 Tool Introduction
     - 2.2 Setup and Configuration
     - 2.3 Scan Results
     - 2.4 Detailed Analysis of Findings
     - 2.5 Fixes Implemented
     - 2.6 Re-scan Results

  3. Container & Dependency Scanning with Trivy
     - 3.1-3.5 (similar structure)

  4. DAST Analysis with OWASP ZAP
     - 4.1-4.10 (comprehensive DAST documentation)

  5. Summary
     - 5.1 Summary of Security Improvements
     - 5.2 Security Posture Before and After
     - 5.3 Remaining Risks and Recommendations
     - 5.4 Lessons Learned

  6. AI Usage
     - 6.1-6.5 (detailed AI interaction documentation)

⏺ Formatting Iterations

> Tables are overflowing the page margins

⏺ Update(header.tex)
  ⎿  Added adjustbox package and AtBeginEnvironment hooks
  ⎿  Tables now use \small font automatically

> Code blocks need syntax highlighting and line numbers

⏺ Update(header.tex)
  ⎿  Configured fvextra with breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true
  ⎿  Added frame=single with codebg background color

> Screenshots need to be embedded

⏺ Added image references using markdown syntax:
  ![Description](screenshots/image-name.png)

  Note: Pandoc automatically converts these to LaTeX \includegraphics

> Page breaks needed between major sections

⏺ Added \newpage commands in markdown:
  - After each major tool section
  - Before appendices
  - Before references

---

⏺ YAML Front Matter Configuration

> Add proper metadata for the PDF

⏺ Update(Assignment-4-Report.md)
  ⎿  Added YAML front matter at beginning:

  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Assignment 4: Security Testing Report"
  subtitle: "Golf Score Tracker & Handicap System"
  author: "Michael Laszlo"
  date: "December 2025"
  subject: "CS763 Secure Software Development"
  keywords: [security testing, SAST, DAST, OWASP ZAP, Bandit, Trivy]
  lang: en
  toc-title: "Table of Contents"
  ---
  ```

  Pandoc uses this metadata to generate title page and PDF properties.

---

⏺ Final Build Verification

⏺ Bash(./build-report.sh)
  ⎿  Generated: Assignment-4-Report.pdf

  Output: 48-page PDF with:
  - Professional title page
  - Automatically generated table of contents
  - Numbered sections and subsections
  - Formatted tables with zebra striping
  - Syntax-highlighted code blocks
  - Embedded screenshots
  - Hyperlinked references
